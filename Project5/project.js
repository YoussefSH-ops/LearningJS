/**
Task:
Create a class called Book that represents a book in a library. The class should have the following features:

1 - A constructor that takes the following parameters:

title (string)
author (string)
price (number)

2 - A method called displayInfo that prints:
    Title: [title]
    Author: [author]
    Price: $[price]

3 - A method called applyDiscount that takes a discount percentage and returns the new price after applying the discount.

example : 
const book1 = new Book("The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald", 15.99);

book1.displayInfo(); // Should print:
                     // Title: The Great Gatsby
                     // Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
                     // Price: $15.99

const discountedPrice = book1.applyDiscount(10); // Apply a 10% discount
console.log(`Discounted price: $${discountedPrice}`); // Should print: Discounted price: $14.39

 */

    constructor(title, author, price) {
        this.title = title
        this.author = author

        console.log(`Title: ${this.title}`)
        console.log(`Author: ${this.author}`)
        console.log(`Price: ${this.price}`)
    }

    applyDiscount(discountPersentage) {
        return this.price - (this.price / 10)
    }
}
const book1 = new Book("The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald", 15.99);
const discountedPrice = book1.applyDiscount(10);
book1.displayInfo();

console.log(`Price after discount : ${discountedPrice}`)
